**IDEA**
The idea is to find the intersection between the lines formed by both the y coordinates and the x coordinates and then the product of those intersections will be the result.
​
Now the question is how to find the intersection...?
​
So to find the intersection part, what we can do is ...
​
1. First we need to create y pairs for both the rectangles.
2. Now we need to find the intersection between their respective coordinate line.
​
```
yr1 = (ay1, ay2);
yr2 = (by1, by2);
​
xr1 = (ax1, ax2);
xr2 = (bx1, bx2);
```
